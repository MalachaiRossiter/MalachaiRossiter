<h1>ðŸ”¥ Welcome to my README! </h1>

Hey there! I'm Malachai Rossiter, a self driven full stack web developer and occasional freelance software developer from Ohio. I learned I had a passion for programming spending evenings with my father writing out "Hello World" in python script as a kid. I took a two year Software Developement course from the Ashtabula County Technical and Career Center and then joined the Coding Dojo Bootcamp to continue furthering my education. My passion for web developement, and programming as whole, lies in the ability to create new things and continue pushing myself to learn.
